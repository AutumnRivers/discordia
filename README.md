## What is this?
A bot for Discord that turns your guild into practically a tycoon.

## Why?
It's a good way to bring members of a guild together, they're all working to reach the top of the leaderboard.

## Hold up... there's a leaderboard?
Yes there is! Your position is determined by how many registered users your guild has, plus the amount of buildings you've finished.

## What does first place get?
Um... bragging rights.

## Cool! Can I invite it?
Of course! This was made for Discord's Hack Week though, so you may or may not find some bugs since I had to make it in less than 5 days.
