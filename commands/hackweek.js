Seems crazy, right? Well, it kinda is. That's why Discordia isn't 100% complete yet. More is to come in the future, but you can get a general idea of how it works with this build.\n\nMore info on Hack Week here: https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33");
